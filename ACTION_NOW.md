## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Browser still shows "Backend unreachable"
**Solution:** 
1. Check backend terminal is showing "APPLICATION STARTED SUCCESSFULLY"
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. Clear cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete

### Problem: Login fails
**Likely Cause:** Wrong credentials (NOT a connectivity issue)
- This is NORMAL if you enter the wrong email/password
- You should see: "Invalid credentials" or similar
- This proves connectivity IS working ✅

### Problem: See other error
**Action:**
1. Copy the error message
2. Check backend terminal for corresponding error
3. Let me know what you see
