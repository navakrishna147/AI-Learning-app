✅ EXPECTED RESULTS WHEN TESTING
================================

When you ask "What is the cost structure of software testing?"

You should get:
✓ Simple explanation of testing costs
✓ Why manufacturing cost is low
✓ Different from physical product testing
✓ Real examples (space vs toy)
✓ Bug fix cost progression
✓ Why this matters
✓ No overly technical language
✓ Organized with key points
✓ About 300-500 words

Within: 3-10 seconds

NOT:
✗ Generic demo response
✗ "Please configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
✗ "development mode response"
✗ Overly technical jargon
✗ Unrelated information
✗ Timeout errors

---

🔍 WHAT YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT
==========================

From the Quality Control content, Chat can teach:

1. MANUFACTURING QUALITY
   ✓ Every stage has quality control
   ✓ Defects are caught and handled
   ✓ Cost includes QA and rework

2. COST-QUALITY BALANCE
   ✓ Too little QA = high total cost (many defects)
   ✓ Too much QA = high inspection costs
   ✓ Optimal point exists

3. INDUSTRY VARIATIONS
   ✓ Consumer products: Low risk = 2% QA cost
   ✓ Life-critical systems: High risk = 80% QA cost
   ✓ Consequences determine spending

4. SOFTWARE ECONOMICS
   ✓ Manufacturing software costs nothing
   ✓ Testing and fixing dominate
   ✓ Quality = Productivity (for software)

5. BUG COSTS BY STAGE
   ✓ Development: $1-5
   ✓ Unit testing: $5-10
   ✓ System testing: $10-50
   ✓ Production: $100+
   ✓ Early detection saves money

---

✨ TEST SCENARIOS PROVIDED
==========================

Scenario 1: Basic Understanding
   User asks: "What is software testing?"
   System: Explains simply, gives examples
   Outcome: User understands basic concepts

Scenario 2: Comparative Learning
   User asks: "Why is spacecraft testing 80% but toy testing 2%?"
   System: Explains risk and consequences
   Outcome: User understands risk-based decisions

Scenario 3: Economic Understanding
   User asks: "Why does finding bugs early cost less?"
   System: Explains cost escalation
   Outcome: User understands ROI of testing

Scenario 4: Integration Understanding
   User asks: "How are quality and productivity related?"
   System: Explains software economics
   Outcome: User sees strategic importance

---

🎓 LEARNING OUTCOMES
====================

After testing with these scenarios, learner will understand:

1. Quality control is standard in manufacturing
2. Testing costs vary by risk and consequence
3. Software testing differs from product testing
4. Early detection saves significant costs
5. Quality and productivity are connected
6. Cost-benefit tradeoffs in QA decisions
7. Why some industries spend 80% on testing
8. Why software needs significant testing investment
