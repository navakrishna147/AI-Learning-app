## 💡 Current User Experience

### BEFORE (Current - Without API Credits)
```
User: "What is the SDLC?"
Chat: 🔴 [Red Error Box]
      "AI service error: Your credit balance is too low 
       to access the Anthropic API..."
User: 😕 "What does that mean? What should I do?"
```

### AFTER (With API Credits)
```
User: "What is the SDLC?"
Chat: 🟢 [Green Response]
      "The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is like 
       the recipe for building software...
       
       Key Points:
       • Planning - Decide what to build
       • Design - Plan how pieces fit together
       • Development - Write the actual code
       • Testing - Check that it works
       • Deployment - Release to users
       
       Real Example: Netflix follows SDLC to build new features,
       test they work, then release to millions of users."
User: 😊 "Great explanation! Now I understand!"
```

🟢 AI Response

Database is like a well-organized filing cabinet. It stores
information in organized tables and finds items quickly.

Key Points:
• Stores information in organized tables (like Excel)
• Finds items quickly (searches millions instantly)
• Keeps data safe and protected
• Multiple people can use it at same time

Real Examples:
1. Your email stores all messages in a database
2. Netflix uses databases to store movies
3. Your school stores student records in a database

Why It Matters: Databases let businesses organize huge
amounts of information that computers can find instantly!
